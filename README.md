These are some repos of my scripts. They were written while working on my SSLQ dataset, LoRA, and some other projects. They were done with assistance from LLMs.

They showcase data prep, conversions, and manipulation. For example going from cleaning json for training,convering json to trainable txt files, and reformatting labels.

There is an XML template used for interface in Label Studio.

There is also a script used to batch process an LLM to describe images using Vertex API.
