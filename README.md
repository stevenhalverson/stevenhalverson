These are some repos of my scripts. They were written while working on my SSLQ dataset, LoRA, and some other projects. They were done with assistance from LLMs.

They showcase data prep, conversions, and manpiulation. For example going from .csv to .json, adding/removing columns, slicing, etc. 

There is an XML template used for interface in Label Studio.

There is also a script that refines data from spreadsheet into .txt for LoRA training.
