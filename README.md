# Hi, I'm Steven 👋

I work at the intersection of **AI annotation, dataset curation, and model training**.  
My current focus is my own **SSLQ image annotation project** using AI generated images (synthetic data) annotated via Label Studi, uploading to Hugging Face, and used in training LoRA image models.

---

### Current Projects
- 🖼️ **SSLQ** — Custom schema, Label Studio setup, 1,200+ curated images (600 annotated) [SSLQ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shalvers/SSLQ-Version-1.600).   
- 🔧 **Workflow Experiments** — Python scripts for preprocessing and exports. Linux and Git for LoRA runs via Runpod cloud services.

### Previous Projects
- 🎲 **Baccarat Simulator (first coding project)** — my early steps into coding projects, kept as is to show the journey. 
- 🗄️ **find_directory_size** — just a quick script, to show better documentation and organization.


💡 My goal: grow from hands-on annotation → **AI Ops / RLHF systems work**.

🤖 I use ChatGPT as a coding and writing assistant — like Stack Overflow, docs, or (gasp!) this readme — but always engage and learn from the code I write.
